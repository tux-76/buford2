ALGEBRA

- Rename doubleSidedSolve to solveTwoSidedEquation for clarity

- "this.constant *= Math.pow(parseFloat(factor.slice(1)), -1);": Only Expects numerical exponents!

- New toString modes
    - A "pretty" form of toString that uses special ASCII characters
    - A website form return using MathJax

- Have different "targets" for simplifyExpression. Some targets may be: compactness, readablility, descending exponent

- Need some form of system of equations for plus or minuses. There needs to be some way to split it up.
    - Should it be a system of eqautions? Will that be confused with a two variable system of equations?

- doubleSidedSolve exponent phase cannot take the square root of a negative number.
