This is the pseudo code for the double sided solve algorithm with examples

BEGIN MAIN FUNCTION <= Equation, Variable (X)
- Do PRE PHASE: Get everything ready
    5(x+4) => 5x+20
- Do TERM PHASE: Move terms with X to the left, terms without to the right
    4+x=5x+8 => -4x=4

- If the left side has only one term: (2x=8)
    - Do FACTOR PHASE: Move all coefficients other than the variable to the right
- Or if the left side has more than one term: (x^2+8x=7)
    - Do SOLVE FOR MULTIPLE TERMS:

- If the left side has only one coefficient:
    - Do EXPONENT PHASE: Move the exponent of the variable to the left

- Return the equation
