ALGEBRA

- Rename doubleSidedSolve to solveTwoSidedEquation for clarity

- "this.constant *= Math.pow(parseFloat(factor.slice(1)), -1);": Only Expects numerical exponents!

- New toString modes
    - A "pretty" form of toString that uses special ASCII characters
    - A website form return using MathJax

- Have different "targets" for simplifyExpression. Some targets may be: compactness, readablility, descending exponent

- Create formula function

- Compress Expression doesn't know how to keep plus or minuses and ends up discarding them
