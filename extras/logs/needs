ALGEBRA
- Substitute variable has support for any types in the original and the replacement, yet the user function only has 
    expressions for each
    - Need to create a "best fit" function to choose class from string in to machine

- Quadratic formula only gives one answer and doesn't do imaginary

- Have different "targets" for simplifyExpression. Some targets may be: compactness, readablility, descending exponent
