Timeline:
	-SAT 11:15 2/12/2022: Buford2 Algebra started
		-SAT 15:38 4/30/2022: Multidimensional array system working??? [Machine readable matrix]
		-MON 20:57 5/9/2022: Just started using VS code after moving to Pop!_OS. It turns out to be a whole lot better than the default text editor I was using previously :)
		-SAT 17:10 5/14/2022: About to change the way the machine readable part works :/ I don't want to have exponents as operation arrays anymore. It seemed to make since in theory but did not work out practicaly.
